# Sample-UISearchController

This example demonstrates the use of the UISearchController class, introduced in iOS 8.

The project is based on the 'TableSearch' sample code from Apple. The original example used UISearchDisplayController which is deprecated in iOS 8.

Each tab uses a UISearchController to display search results in a different way:

In a table view, very similar to using UISearchDisplayController

In a collection view

In place, essentially filtering the original table view
